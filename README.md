## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally on your machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BuddhirajNagarkoti/Portfolio-2026.git
   cd Portfolio-2026
   ```

2. **Run a local server:**
   Since the game uses external assets and modular scripts, it's best viewed through a local server. You can use the included batch file (Windows) or any static server:
   ```bash
   # Using npx (simplest)
   npx http-server . -p 8080
   ```

3. **Enjoy the ride:**
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080` and start scrolling!
